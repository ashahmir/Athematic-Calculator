🧮 Terminal Calculator (Python Edition)
Welcome to your very own Terminal Calculator — a chill, no-fluff calculator that runs in your terminal and gets the job done without all the fancy UI stuff.

If you're just starting out in Python, or you just want a quick tool to crunch numbers, this little guy has your back.

💥 What Can It Do?
➕ Add numbers

➖ Subtract one from another

✖️ Multiply two values

➗ Divide them up (yes, even decimals)

Oh, and here's the fun part:

👉 It remembers your last result! So if you're in a math mood, just hit = to keep going from where you left off.

🧑‍💻 How to Use
Open your terminal.

Run the code.

Type in your numbers and pick an operation:

+
-
*
/
Choose an operation: *
Get your result.

Wanna keep going with that result? Type =

Wanna start over? Type n

Repeat as long as your math brain survives 🧠

🖼️ But Wait, There's ASCII Art?!
Yup. Thanks to the art module, your calculator kicks off with some sweet ASCII to make you feel like a hacker 😎

🔁 Loop Mode
Tired of typing everything again and again? Just press = and continue using the previous result. It’s like the calculator remembers what you were thinking 🧠✨

🧠 Why This Exists
This is a simple project meant for:

Beginners in Python 🐍

People learning how functions work

Understanding how to use loops and dictionaries

Making CLI apps feel just a bit cooler with ASCII

❓ Common Questions
Can I divide by 0?
Technically yes, but Python will freak out. You can add a try/except block to fix that if you're feeling spicy.

Can I add more stuff like modulus, power, etc.?
Heck yeah! Just make a new function and slap it into the calc_functions dictionary.

🧼 Clean Console?
To keep things tidy, the calculator prints "\n" * 100 every time. It’s a simple trick to "clear" the screen without using OS-level commands.

⚙️ Bonus Ideas to Try
Add square root and exponent options

Add error handling (e.g., division by zero)

Make a GUI version in tkinter if you're feeling brave

Let the user enter a full equation like 3 + 4 * 5
